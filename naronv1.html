		Here I am just going to enter a wall of text so I have some orginal content to work with and I will 
		move thisaround as needed in the future.  I really appreciate you reading this if someone ever does, 
		because at least the words will have some use.</div>
	<h2 class="headers"> Case Choice </h2>
	<div class="intro">
			I will discuss my new computer build as that has been on my mind lately as I have just finished 
			for the most part.  I started with the basics of a Corsair Carbide Air Series 540. This allowed 
			me to have a lot of room and keep critical components such as my video card and motherboard in a 
			seperate space from my hard drives, power supply unit, dvd writer and most cabling.  This case 
			also features "hot swappable" hard drive bays in the bottom to do any later additions or to work 
			on hard drives for other units.  See below for pictures.</div>

				<div class="imgtxt"><p>This is the front view of my case, Notice how the front metal grid has 
				really nice airflow to the left-most chamber.  This is the chamber that will accept the 
				Motherboard, CPU, Graphics card (GPU) and the memory chips (RAM).  These elements create most 
				of the extreme heat that you will witness when running high performance gaming or computing.  
				This is the maine rason that I chose this particular case.</p></div>

			    <div class="imgtxt"><p>In this image you will see the motherboard side of the case.  You can 
			    see the dual fans that go behind the metal grill I mentioned above.  This will bring air <em>
			    into</em> the case and allow for extra air cooling.  There is also a fan at the rear of the 
			    case that will act as the <em>exhaust</em>. The case also makes a really nice presentation as 
			    you will notice the large rubber grommets that will allow you to route the cabling through them 
			    with limited exposure to the awesome "window" into the side of the machine.</p></div>
